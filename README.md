# Telegram-bot
A great telegram bot that has some interesting commands to play with.

# How to use it?
1. **Download the zip file in the releases tab**
2. Unzip the file
3. Open the folder in visual studio code
4. Install telebot, keras, PIL and numpy modules using "pip install" command
5. Go to telegram channel @BotFather
6. Generate your bot and copy it's token
7. In the line where is the variable bot insert your bots token

# DO NOT SHARE YOUR BOT TOKEN TO ANYBODY ELSE, IF THEY ARE ASKING FOR IT THEY ARE TRYING TO STEAL YOUR BOT AND USING AGAINST SOMETHING OFFENSIVE AND YOU'LL GET THE BLAME FOR IT
9. Anyways after inserting the bots token run the script
10. Find your bot in telegram through search option
11. And enjoy!

# How to add your own commands?
Well it is simple;
1. You need to go to bot_logic.py and make a function that does the thing that you want
2. in main.py you'll see this at the top "from bot_logic import gen_pass, gen_emoji, flip_coin" well add your functions name to it, e.g. "from bot_logic import gen_pass, gen_emoji, flip_coin, some_function"
3. create a function inside of main.py on what should bot do

**Remember that if you have any troubles or problems with it try to take some examples from other commands and DO NOT ask me if you have any problems, use chatgpt, youtube videos, google searches or python documentations to find to the problem a solution**

I hope I clarified enough for you to understand what's going on.

# Note: I probably won't give any updates to this bot plus Im just a rookie in programming so don't expect a lot.
